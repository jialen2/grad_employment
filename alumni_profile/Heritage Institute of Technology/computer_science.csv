All actual circuit elements such as inductors, diodes, and transistors have internal capacitance, which can cause their behavior to depart from that of 'ideal' circuit elements. If negative capacitance is generated to be parallel with a positive capacitance, they would have cancelling effects since the total current flowing through them is the difference of the two. We have demonstrated this parasitic capacitance cancellation."
